
# Intrusion Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Techniques

## üöÄ Project Overview
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a critical role in maintaining the security of networks by identifying malicious activities. Traditional IDS solutions struggle with high false-positive rates and often fail to detect sophisticated, evolving threats. This project proposes a **Hybrid Deep Learning-Based IDS** that utilizes **Autoencoders**, **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**, and **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory)** to achieve high accuracy in detecting and classifying network intrusions.

### Key Features:
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines autoencoders for feature extraction with CNN-LSTM for spatial-temporal analysis.
- **Multi-class Detection**: Identifies a range of network anomalies, including DoS, DDoS, and probing attacks.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle extensive datasets and real-time traffic.
- **User Interface**: Includes a browser-based interface for real-time analysis and visualization.

## üåü Introduction
The increasing sophistication of cyber threats has highlighted the need for intelligent, adaptive, and real-time IDS solutions. By integrating deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance intrusion detection by:
- Extracting meaningful features with **autoencoders**.
- Analyzing spatial features using **CNN layers**.
- Capturing temporal dependencies with **LSTM layers**.

This hybrid approach reduces false positives and ensures robust anomaly detection in diverse network environments.
