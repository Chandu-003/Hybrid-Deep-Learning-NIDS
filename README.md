# Ransomware Detection Using Explainable AI

## üöÄ Project Overview
Ransomware attacks are among the most prevalent and sophisticated cybersecurity threats, with evolving techniques that evade traditional detection mechanisms. This project presents a novel approach to ransomware detection using **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques such as **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** and **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**. 

The model employs a machine learning-based **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to classify ransomware and benign files accurately. The integration of XAI ensures transparency in decision-making, allowing security analysts to understand why the model makes specific predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Explainable AI Integration**: Offers local and global explanations for predictions.
- **High Accuracy Detection**: Uses ANN for robust ransomware classification.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights the most critical features contributing to predictions.
- **Transparency**: Builds trust with interpretable machine learning techniques.

## üåü Introduction
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom for decryption. The rapid evolution of ransomware necessitates advanced detection mechanisms. This project leverages a combination of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and XAI tools to provide a reliable and interpretable ransomware detection system.

This system addresses key limitations of traditional detection methods, such as:
- Inability to detect novel ransomware variants.
- Lack of interpretability in machine learning models.

With XAI tools like LIME and SHAP, this project ensures that predictions are not only accurate but also explainable, making it easier for cybersecurity professionals to trust and adopt the system.
